Functions in JavaScript

Functions: Functions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow the code to be called many times without repetition.

Function Declaration Format: Functions are declared using the function keyword followed by the function name and parameters enclosed in parentheses. The function body is enclosed in curly braces {}.

Default Parameters in Function: Default parameters in function declarations allow you to set default values for parameters if no value or undefined is passed when the function is called.

Local variables: A variable declared inside a function is only visible inside that function.

Global variables: Variables declared outside of any function, accessible from anywhere on the webpage, including within functions. They can be utilized across different scopes within the script.

Function expressions:

'A function expression in JavaScript is a way to define a function as part of an expression syntax. function expressions are typically defined within other expressions, such as variable assignments or function parameters. They are not hoisted to the top of the scope and are only created when the execution flow reaches them.'
