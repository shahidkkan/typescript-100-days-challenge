What is the Internet?
The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols.

Wires, Cables, and Wi-Fi
Information on the Internet moves from one computer to another in the form of bits over various mediums, including Ethernet cables, fiber optic cables, and wireless signals (i.e., radio waves).

IP Addresses and DNS
IP Addresses are numerical labels assigned to devices on a network, used to identify and locate devices. DNS is a system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, making it easier for users to access websites without needing to remember complex numerical addresses. Together, they facilitate seamless navigation and communication over the Internet.

Packets, Routing, and Reliability:
Packets: In networking, data transmitted over the internet is broken down into smaller units called packets. Each packet contains a portion of the data being sent, along with metadata that helps it reach its destination.
Key points about packets:
Structure:

Header: Contains control information such as source and destination IP addresses, packet number, and error-checking data.
Payload: The actual data being transmitted.
Size: Typically ranges from 64 bytes to 1500 bytes in standard Ethernet networks.
Fragmentation: Large messages are divided into smaller packets for efficient transmission and reassembled at the destination.
router
A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet. Data sent through the internet, such as a web page or email, is in the form of data packets. A packet is typically forwarded from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an internetwork (e.g., the Internet) until it reaches its destination node.

Reliability
Reliability in networking ensures that data is transmitted accurately and in order, despite any issues that may occur during transmission. This is critical for maintaining the integrity of the communication.

Example: When you send an email:

-Packets: The email message is broken into smaller packets.

-Routing: Each packet is routed through various routers across the internet. Each router decides the best path based on its routing table.

-Reliability: TCP ensures that all packets arrive at the destination and are correctly reassembled into the original email message. If any packets are lost or corrupted, TCP handles retransmission.

HTTP and HTML
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): HTTP is a protocol used for transferring hypertext requests and information on the internet. It forms the foundation of any data exchange on the web and is a protocol used for fetching resources such as HTML documents.
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is the standard markup language used to create and design documents on the web. It describes the structure of web pages using markup.
Encryption and Public Keys
Encryption transforms data to protect it from unauthorized access. It comes in two main types: symmetric (using a single key for both encryption and decryption) and asymmetric (using a pair of keys, public and private). Public keys are part of asymmetric encryption, where the public key encrypts data and the private key decrypts it. This system ensures secure communication and data exchange. Public keys also enable digital signatures, verifying the integrity and authenticity of data. Together, encryption and public keys ensure confidentiality, security, and trust in digital communications.

Cybersecurity and Cybercrime:
Cybersecurity aims to protect systems, networks, and data from digital threats through various technologies, practices, and measures.
Cybercrime involves criminal activities conducted via computers or the internet, such as phishing, identity theft, ransomware, and hacking. Effective cybersecurity practices and proactive measures are essential to prevent cybercrime, protect sensitive information, and ensure the safety and security of digital assets.
