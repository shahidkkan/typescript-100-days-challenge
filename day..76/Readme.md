In this above artical
DNS: (Domain Name System)
DNS stands for "Domain Name System/Server/Service." It is an automatic process that converts domain names to their corresponding IP addresses (numbers) so that web browsers can understand which web page you want to access on the internet.

DHCP: (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
DHCP automates the assignment of IP addresses and network configuration parameters to devices on a network, streamlining network management and reducing configuration errors. It involves a lease process where the DHCP server offers, assigns, and manages IP addresses for clients, ensuring efficient and accurate IP address allocation.
